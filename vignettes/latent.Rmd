This vignette shows how to implement the latent projection predictive inference from @latent-projpred in `projpred`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("stan-dev/projpred", ref = "latent_projection")
# import necessary libraries for the vignette
library(magrittr)
library(brms)
library(projpred)
# set number of cores

## General idea

For generalised linear models whose variate's distribution does not belong to the exponential family, the KL divergence minimisation problem solved in projection is not analytically easy to compute in general. This is the foundational idea of efficient projection predictive inference. In order to bypass this issue, we solve the KL minimisation in the latent predictive space $p(\tilde{\eta}|\lambda_*)$ under the general model formulation for data $\mathcal{D}=\{\boldsymbol X | y\}$
$$
y\sim p(\mu, \phi),\quad\mu = g(\eta),\quad \eta\sim p(\lambda|\boldsymbol X),
$$
where we have regressions parameters $\lambda$, inverse link function $g(\cdot)$, and $\eta$ is called the latent predictor.

We make the assumption in this setting that the latent predictor has a Gaussian distribution, since it is the linear combination of our data and our regressors and has infinite support. In the case where $\eta$ has two finite moments, then we know from @cover-thomas that over all distributions with two finite moments and infinite support, the Gaussian distribution has the higher differential entropy. In doing so, we return to the "easy" exponential family case, and can implement the original `projpred` workflow once more.

## Exponential GLM example

In the case of an exponential variate distribution, it has been shown in @latent-projpred this Gaussian approximation can improve training times and occasionally identify superior search paths to vanilla `projpred`.

To begin with, we generate some fake Poisson GLM data.

```{r}
# generate random data
generate_fake_poisson_data <-
  function(N = 100,
           G = round(N / 10),
           P = 3) {
    # regression coefficients
    beta <- rnorm(P)
    # sampled covariates, group means and fake data
    fake <- matrix(rnorm(N * P), ncol = P)
    dimnames(fake) <- list(NULL, paste0("x", 1:P))
    # fixed effect part and sampled group membership
    fake <- transform(as.data.frame(fake),
                      theta = fake %*% beta,
                      g = sample.int(G, N, replace = TRUE))
    # add random intercept by group
    fake  <-
      merge(fake, data.frame(g = 1:G, eta = rnorm(G)), by = "g")
    # linear predictor
    fake  <- transform(fake, mu = theta + eta)
    # sample Poisson data
    fake  <- transform(fake, y = rpois(N, exp(mu)))
    # shuffle order of data rows to ensure even distribution of computational effort
    fake <- fake[sample.int(N, N), ]
    # drop not needed row names
    rownames(fake) <- NULL
    return(fake)
  }
set.seed(300416)
pois <- generate_fake_poisson_data()
```

We begin by fitting some reference model we believe to be a good fit to the data in BRMS.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# build complete reference model on the variate
poisson_priors <- set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b")
poisson_formula <- y ~ 1 + x1 + x2
model_poisson <- brm(
  formula = poisson_formula,
  data = pois,
  family = poisson(),
  prior = poisson_priors,
  seed = 300416
)
```

We now extract a reference model in terms of the latent predictor under the Gaussianity assumption. This is done in `projpred` by setting `latent_proj = TRUE`.

```{r}
# define new reference model for latent predictor
latent_ref <- get_refmodel(
  model_poisson,
  latent_proj = TRUE
)
```

Now having a reference model where the variate's distribution belongs to the exponential family (in this case it is Gaussian), we are able to employ the standard `varsel` function from `projpred` to perform variable selection. The results are then plotted below.

```{r}
# perform variable selection on the latent reference model
latent_vs <- varsel(latent_ref, seed = 95930)
# selection order of the variables
solution_terms(latent_vs)
# plot varsel results
plot(latent_vs, stats = c('elpd', 'rmse'), seed = 4537)
```

We can compare this implementation of latent projection predictive variable selection to vanilla `projpred` since the underlying covariate does in fact have distribution belonging to the exponential family. This is done below.

```{r}
# get reference model from BRMS object
refmodel <- get_refmodel(model_poisson)
# perform variable selection
vanilla_vs <- varsel(refmodel, seed = 95930)
# selection order of the variables
solution_terms(vanilla_vs)
# plot results
plot(vanilla_vs, stats = c('elpd', 'rmse'), seed = 4537)
```

## Time-to-event models

We now turn to a non-Exponential family distributed variate. Specifically, we will be working with a time-to-event model in BRMS where the variate is Weibull distributed according to 
$$
f(y) = \frac{\alpha}{s} \left(\frac{y}{s}\right)^{\alpha-1}  \exp\left(-\left(\frac{y}{s}\right)^\alpha\right),
$$
and is dealing with censored data from the lung cancer dataset from @lung. We note that in general, the Weibull distribution is not a member of the exponential family In fact this is only the case when the shape parameter $\alpha$ is known and fixed.

We first process our data as follows.

```{r}
# read data from `survival` library
data("cancer", package = "survival")
# build dataset
data <- cancer %>%
  tidyr::drop_na()
# identify covariate labels
xtags <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(-status, -time) %>%
  colnames()
```

We now define a simple GLM formula with censored data, and some Gaussian prior over the regressors (note that this is independent to our Gaussianity assumption over the latent predictor) and fit it accordingly in BRMS.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# build model formula of the form
formula <- formula(paste("time | cens(2 - status) ~",
                         paste0(xtags, collapse = " + ")))
# define prior assumption of variate
prior <- set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b")
# fit covariate GLM model with BRMS, expliciting a non-exponential family
fit <- brm(
  formula,
  data = data,
  prior = prior,
  family = weibull,
  seed = 300416
)
```

Repeating the workflow, we first extract the latent predictor posterior draws, and then define a reference model in terms of them. It is at this stage that we enforce our Gaussianity assumption in the default parameter value of the `fit_latent` function.

```{r}
# define new reference model for latent predictor
latent_ref <- get_refmodel(
  fit,
  latent_proj = TRUE
)
```

Having now build a reference model belonging to the Exponential family from a model originally Weibull-distributed, we can employ variable selection with `projpred`.

```{r}
# perform latent projection predictive variable selection on model
vs <- varsel(latent_ref, seed = 456942)
# selection order of the variables
solution_terms(vs)
# plot varsel results
plot(vs, stats = c('elpd', 'rmse'), seed = 842032)
```

We thus discover an ordering of variables in this non-exponential family model using latent projection predictive inference.
